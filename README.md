# .Files

Configuration files I use in different workstations.

Files are located in different branches.

Checkout to home or lab depending on where you're working.

## HOME
- .bashrc
- .vimrc
- .config
   - i3
   - polybar


## LAB
- .bashrc
- .vimrc
- .config
   - i3
   - polybar

## FH (MacOS)
- .zshrc
